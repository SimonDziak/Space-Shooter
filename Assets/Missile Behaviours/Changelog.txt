Version 1.5.3
- Minor fixes
- Minor script additions
- New Prefab "Piercing Missile"

Version 1.5.2
- Minor Scene fixes

Version 1.5.1
- All missiles now use rigidbody interpolation. To keep things from looking weird, the camera is now using Update instead of FixedUpdate.
- The GuidanceDemo scene now instantly spawns a target, instead of waiting for a few seconds.
- All triggers can now be delayed by a specified amount of seconds. They will only trigger once its object has been alive for longer than that. This should fix the problem with missiles exploding in the silo, while also having some other uses.
- Added a proximity trigger to the non-carrier missiles. The missiles should now explode when they are too close to the ground. This is a quick fix for the whole ground collision problem.
- Fixed some warnings: Target colliders are no longer negative scale, as this works differently in Unity 5.5 than it did in Unity 5.0 (and differently still in Unity 5.3...). Further, the ToggleExhaust script now uses the new particle system API, avoiding another warning.
- Removed particle scaling script because it didn't do anything.

Version 1.5
- Control scripts are now running in FixedUpdate again, as running them in Update caused them to miss in specific cases.
  This, unfortunately, means that their rotation will look a bit more sluggish now, but this should be of little concern and not be an issue if interpolation is enabled.
- Added the ThrottleCurve script, which uses a curve to control a missiles throttle over time.
- Added the BallisticGuidance script, which can be used to create certain behaviours for unguided missiles.
- Added several new prefabs which make use of the new scripts.
- Added a new demo scene to show off some of the new prefabs.
- Added an axis selection to the SpawnSwarm script.
- Added the OnLevelFlight trigger script, which triggers if the X-rotation of an object comes within a certain margin of error around 0 degrees. In other words, it triggers when a missile hits level flight.
- Updated ReadMe.
- Added support for the latest Unity versions, which messed some things up.
- Fixed some miscellaneous errors and oddities mostly concerning the demo scenes.
- Added a new Layer "GroundTargets" specifically for the waypoint demo.

Version 1.4
- Fixed and improved some tooltips.
- Added an active target property to the missile controller. This target, if set, will always be the first the missile will try to reach. The normal target will be used if this is null.
  This can be used to control the path of the missile. Even waypoint systems should be easy to do now, while still maintaining the original target.
- Added OnTargetChange event to the missile controller. This event can notify any listening scripts whenever the missiles target has been changed.
- Added OnActiveTargetChange event to the missile controller. This event can notify any listening scripts whenever the missiles active target has been changed.
- Updated and slightly improved readme file.
- Added the AltitudeControl script which you can find in the actions folder and namespace. However, this is technically not the same as other options, since it's not triggerable.
- Added a new scene to showcase the new script.

Version 1.3
- New action script: Disperse.cs
	- This script introduces some random rotation, which can be used to create a dispersion effect.
	- Look at the new demo to see how it works.

Version 1.2
- Now compatible with Unity 4.6 & 5.0
- Reworked lots of things:
	- Every class now has tooltips.
	- Completely redone demo scene.
	- Every action script is now also a trigger.
	- Redone ReadMe.
	- The Explode action script now has a variable to introduce a delay to the destruction of the gameobject.
	- Added more comments to some scripts.
- Added the new SpawnSwarm action script.
	- When triggered this script will spawn a number of prefabs around the missile in a radial pattern.
- Added five new prefabs which all use the new SpawnSwarm script to show you how it works.

Version 1.1
- Added fuel feature
- Added the new SearchForNewTarget action script.
	- This script is a trigger and an action at the same time.
	- When triggered it will search for a new target within a certain range.
	- If it can not find a target it will fire an event itself, which you can use the same way as any other trigger script.
